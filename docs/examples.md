A manuscript is composed of a YAML header and a body. The YAML header contains the metadata of the manuscript,
such as the title, authors, affiliations, and abstract. The body contains the content of the manuscript, such as the 
introduction, methods, and results. The body is written in Markdown, a simple markup language. The YAML header is 
written in YAML, a simple data serialization language. The YAML header is separated from the body by three dashes `---`.
Detailed metadata of the manuscript specified in the YAML header is explained in the template description.
